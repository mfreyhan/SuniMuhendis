# Leaderboard

Each model receives a task's prompt once per run and has to answer with a
complete heat-exchanger design in a single attempt, with no feedback. Every
answer goes through the same schema, design-rule, simulation, and scoring
stages as any other design.

Tasks are ranked separately. Each task pins its own simulator and score
version, so a score from one task cannot be compared with a score from another.

## Reading the table

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Mean score | Average score over every attempt except those that never ran (client errors and token-limit stops). Failed designs count as `0.0`. |
| Valid design | Share of attempts that passed schema, design-rule checks, and simulation. |
| Requirements met | Share of attempts whose design reaches the duty target and stays inside both pressure-drop limits. |
| Best | Highest score any single attempt reached. |
| Cost | Total spend for the recorded runs, as charged or priced at run time. |

The numbers are computed from the run records under
[`results/`](../results/EXPERIMENT_TRACKS.md) each time the site is built.
